# In-class
Iâ€™ve had a decent amount of experience with computers, I work at a hardware store where I maintain the computers we use for the paint machines. In addition, I have taken many computers related classes: 
- CS I, II, III
- a two semester Cisco Certified networking course 
- intro to Linux 
- intro to Python 
- PC maintenance 
- Windows server & support
- network security. 
I do not have many finished projects unfortunately the only completed project I have is one I made in python for a game my friends and I play. It would take different images and create an image combining them in different patterns.  

I am hoping to be able to use what i learn in this course to allow myself to make a wide range of projects. The most difficult part of making projects for me is developing a GUI.
