Updating git

command git pull to update all repositories changed on other terminals

### Using Commits

Git & Github keeps track of updates through the commit history in the main branch

Branches are used to work on new features sepratly from the main code as too not introduce bugs

Git Hub actions allow to compile projects for any OS including OSX & IOS

Git hub pages is a static file server it is not able to be used for dynamic files such as Vue

### Today's Objective 

discuss types of hosting:
- Web Hosting/Cloud Hosting: Runs a Docker container for an application 

Render.com: create an account through github using [[#Ooth]] allows hosting of webapp apps
Vercel.com: Serverless hosting meaning it does not use a container or VM when someone attempts to connect to the server it uses the minimum amount of resources needed for the client to access it 

#### Ooth:
 takes making a web application and "makes it infinite" allows webapp to share information Lets two web services talk to each other and share user information

 Scaling up vs scaling out
 scaling up : building your own servers
 scaling out: using hosting services 

 there will be a homework assignment to send the render.com link & github pages link for a website that will be a recreation of the website linked to on brightspace.

 use f12 to inspect element this class will primarily focus on the Console, Elements, Source and Network tabs Console is a way to send messages to the user 

### Optimizing code
when optimizing for web applications the key point is how fast can you get the information to the client 

View Source vs Inspect Elements:
- View source gives the raw HTML from the server 
- Inspect elements edits the HTML to display differently if the Source is too ambiguous as well as it gets changed 
by the java script on the page
